	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>This lab's subject is a refresher on the main parts of HTML code.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>I struggled with linking my image to my homepage, HOWEVER, after I got help from Wes and had him zoom into my teeth/forehead for some reason, I was able to figure it out.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>I think my homepage looks great! It's basic, but good.</p>
