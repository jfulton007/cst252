Task 1: How to brush your teeth properly.
1. Wet your toothbrush with sink water.
2. Put toothpaste on your toothbrush.
3. Start brushing slowly and carefully, making sure to get harder to reach areas and your lower gum line.
4. After doing this for three minutes, spit out everything and rinse your mouth out with mouthrinse or water. You’re ready to start eating & repeat the process later that night!

3. Click on which game you’d like to install, then hit the bright blue “INSTALL” button.

<h1>Challenges</h1>
<p>The main struggle for this lab for me was not being able to understand how to properly use pre code yet within html code.</p>

<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>The main problem with this lab for me was getting the body paragraphs to split apart.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<p>The main result of this lab was.. alright at best. I didn't like how the body text turned out, but it worked otherwise.</p>
